			<h1>Our Story</h1>
			<p class="intro">Way back in 2007, PMG, a leading direct mail production management company, realized there was a growing need for nonprofits to take their message online. They knew that nonprofits needed to build online communities interested in their causes, provide an easy way for those communities to become involved and increase fundraising potential.</p>
			<p>PMG set out to build a team of technically-savvy, experienced fundraising pros to take fundraising online with all the same strong project management skills, constant communications and value as they’d built a reputation on in the direct mail production world since 1997.</p>
			<p>So a few of us were hired as the ’online team.’ It didn’t take long for us to build a list of clients as we quickly began helping more and more nonprofits successfully execute fundraising strategies online. It became evident that we (the ‘online team’) needed its own identity, its own name. Thus, The Engage Group came into being as the newest member of the PMG family.</p>
