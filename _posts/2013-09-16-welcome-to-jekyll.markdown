## Kelley Kelly is the newest project manager at The Engage Group

Exciting things are happening around here – most notably, we are welcoming Kelley Kelly to our project management team next week! Kelley Kelly – yes, that is her real name – will be joining The Engage Group on Monday, August 19, and we are so very excited.

Kelley Kelly was not born with the same name twice; she gamely took on the second Kelly when she married her husband a little over a year ago. Apparently, even the people at the Social Security Administration asked her if she was really, really sure that she wanted to change last names! Since getting married, Kelley and Mr. Kelly have welcomed a new family member, a one-year-old yellow lab named Piper. The whole Kelley family lives in Columbia, Maryland and Kelley is beyond happy that her commute will be quick and easy.

When Kelley is not at work, she loves to stay active and says she cannot sit still. One of her favorite ways to burn off excess energy is to take on various exciting – and dangerous ­– fitness challenges. While living in Australia, Kelley went on a trip to New Zealand, where, due to a scheduling hiccup, she went bungee jumping and skydiving on the same day.

Thankfully, nothing about her work at The Engage Group will be so harrowing.

Kelley has more than 7 years of experience in direct response and most recently worked at Merkle. We cannot wait for her arrival on Monday and look forward to working with Mrs. Kelley Kelly!
